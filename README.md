# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv9

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the **YOLOv9** model with **OpenCV** and **PyTorch**. The script captures video from the webcam, processes each frame using a pre-trained YOLOv9 model, and displays bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

## Features

- Real-time video capture using OpenCV
- Object detection using pre-trained YOLOv9
- Bounding boxes and confidence scores displayed on screen
- GPU acceleration support (if available)
